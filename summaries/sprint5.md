# Summary for Week 5

## Capucine
This week, I finally finished the database side of our app. We are now able to safely put and retrieve  users from Firebase Firestore. 

Things got a bit out of hand PR size wise. As I learned everything about dependencies and MVVM along the way (which took way more time than I thought), I was not able to correctly cut my code into more manageable pull requests… 

Next week, I’d like to work on some UI, maybe the EditProfilePage.

## Melissa
For this week I worked on the settings. I added the remaining options for the settings, and I gave a quick makeover to the overall page.

I managed the size of my PR pretty well, and I separated the two tasks into two PRs so that it would be easier to merge. I overestimated the time it would take me to finish the tasks, so I worked less than expected.

For next week I’ll try to work on some backend, I’ll discuss it with the other when we assign the tasks.

## Kilian
In this sprint, I finished the recording activity. I terminated tests and resolved some issues. There are still some little bugs that need to be solved, but I don’t think it will take us a lot of time.

The task took me a little more time than expected, but I decided to add some things that weren’t necessary. Overall, I think I managed my time pretty well over the 2 weeks, as I worked a little bit during holidays.

Next week, I can resolve the little bugs of the recording activity and begin working on something new. 

## Çağın
For this week I added the facebook sign-in option to our authentication functionalities. I also looked for ways to implement chat, watched videos and read documentations in order to use the Realtime Database. 

I’ve tried a couple of implementations, in the end I managed to pass messages to the Database.

For next week I’ll try to implement Chat in a more concrete way. For this UI will take some time as well so this should better be in two separate tasks.

## Richard
This week I implemented the UI for the matches (the swipes). In the beginning I found a library that could help me in my task but it wasn’t working as intended. So I searched for another one and found one quite simple to use and now it is all ok. I began to test the code I wrote but had some trouble to test the cards (the profiles to swipe) due to the duplication of them in the layout (it's a stack of cards).

Next week I will finish to test what I have done and document the code I wrote or maybe begin a new task.

## Tibor (Scrum master)
During this scrum I added a map live-tracking the user position, it is possible to add multiple points to the map. In the future we will use this to show the other users to the current user. I also began to write a solution to resolve bugs with flaky tests.

I think that I didn't manage my time well during these two weeks, which led me to being a bit lost. I still had trouble with CI, therefore I couldn't merge.

Next week I will try to merge everything. I will also accept other tasks.

## Overall Team
This sprint was a bit different because it lasted for two weeks, some of us worked a bit during the holidays, other didn't.

I think the communication was good, we had two stand-up meetings that worked well and lasted between 15-30 minutes. The first being the longer, compensating for the meetings we didn't do during the holidays.
Overall we achieved our goals.

We almost cleared the sprint backlog, which is maybe a first. However, we still have on-going sprint tasks, but they are in their way of being completed.

For next sprint, I think it is good that we continue to focus on finishing on all tasks as the effort we put into that this week seem to have paid.
