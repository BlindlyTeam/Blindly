# Summary for Week 2

## Capucine
I implemented the UI of the profile and settings pages, which also required me to create the skeletons of the app interface.

Getting the UI to look exactly as I want it to was very time consuming. As I had no previous experience with a lot of the UI elements, it was mostly trial and errors, so it took me a lot more time than I expected.

Next week, I will finish the settings page and maybe start on the info editing feature of the profile.
 

## Richard
This week, I finished implementing the LocationService for the app and the activity map displays well the location where the user is. This took me 5 more hours and the merging part took 2 more hours.

I hadn’t too many problems finishing my task this week (appart that it took 2 weeks to finish). I’ll try to take a smaller task (or a part or a bigger task that can be split) to be more accurate on my time.

I can choose another task for next week to work on.


## Kilian
I added a timer for audio recording and audio playing. I implemented a progress bar for the audio player. It moves forward correctly, but it is not possible to navigate in the audio file by using it yet.

My time estimation was pretty close to the amount of time I spent on the project this week. I even had time to refactor the code of my activity and to fix an issue about recordings that couldn’t be overwritten.

For next week, I’ll try to make the audio bar usable and find out where exactly we need to store the audio files.


## Melissa (Scrum Master)
I wrote the basic shape of the User class and the tests for it. It can still be augmented with helper methods but we will need to discuss the architecture of the app a bit further.

I had trouble getting started with Kotlin, as I'm not familiar with the language. It took me a lot of time to read documentations and examples and I'm still not comfortable with some features. I also had trouble trying to merge the authentication, I had to discuss with Tibor to understand the functionning.

For next week, I'll make sure to learn more about Kotlin and discuss more with other when I'm stuck instead of spending hours on the code.


## Tibor
I merged the authentication process into the app, and I continued to try to do efficient tests on the UserHelper class, which has proven to be more difficult than I originally thought. Testing static methods on Android seems to be, almost, impossible. Therefore I think I will refactor the code into a non-static class.

I took more time on the tests than estimated, however as I got a bit lost on what I was supposed to do I worked for less than 8 hours.

For next week, I'll consult my colleagues to know where I can be the most useful.


## Çağın 
This week I’ve added Passions screen to the Profile Preferences and I did the input checks and added error messages in response to incorrect inputs. 

While my time allocation for the former was accurate, the latter still took more than I expected. Emulator problems and discovering testing interfaces still had an impact.

I wasn’t able to do the check on Passions and Orientations as I couldn’t yet solve the problem I faced about ChipGroups. Next week, I need to handle this and then I’ll be available to work on some new tasks.


## Overall Team
We merged all features of last week and made really good progress this week. We have a nice starting skeleton for the demo. We had some trouble with pull requests and Cirrus but we were able to resolve them by rerunning multiple times. 
Overall communication was good, we had our 2 stand up meeting that went well, they both took less than 15 minutes.

Estimations were a little better than for the first sprint but still not perfect. We have to write more user stories and discuss more about the architecture organization of the app.
