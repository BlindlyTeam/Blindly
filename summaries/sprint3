#Summary for sprint 3

##Richard:
This week, I incorporated the map into the actual settings of the app to display the user location. This took me a bit more time than expected but the target time spent is close to the actual one. 

The size of the task was better than the previous one: it was easier to resolve conflicts and to test. The fact that we did not merge all the tasks at the same moment was better. The merging was smoother.

For next week I can work on a new task.

##Kilian:
I started to work on the UI of the audio recording, but it is not finished yet as the UI is quite complex to do. I spent some time reviewing some PR and resolving conflicts to merge our work on main.

I had less time to work on the project this week, but I can certainly say that this task will take more than 8 hours. I’ve not spent that time on it yet, but the UI is harder to do than I thought. I split my task into 3 parts and was able to merge the first one.

For next week, I think we still need to be better at splitting tasks and merging them earlier. I’ll continue working on the UI for audio recording.

##Mélissa:
This week, I took over Kilian’s work on the audio recordings. I found a way to store the audio files in the appropriate directory and implemented a way to delete temporary files once they aren’t needed anymore. I also implement a way to list all saved recordings and to play/pause them. Finally, I implemented a way to select a recording and save it as the “principal” recording so that it doesn’t get deleted like the other temporary files.

I underestimated the time it would take me to implement the audio library. Finding the proper way to store files was done quicker than I thought, but the RecyclerView gave me a hard time. I also had a lot of work for other classes so I didn’t get the time to finish all tests in time for the meeting, nor the third task that was assigned to me. I have not been able to respect what we discussed at the last meeting, which is to make smaller PRs more often and earlier in the week.

For next week, I’ll finish testing the audio library and make a PR right away, and then I’ll work on the slider navigation through the audio file. 

##Capucine:
I started implementing the registration of users with Firebase. For this I had to introduce a database to store the user’s information and find a way to get them from when the user entered his preferences.

This week was very busy so I didn’t have the time to finish this task, I still need to test the backend part.

Next week I’d like to make all these tests and maybe start on retrieving the user information.

##Çağın:

This week I completed the input checks for profile preferences. The estimated time would be accurate if I wouldn’t need to spend too much time on issues with Cirrus. The builds failed many times with technical problems and even tests locally passing didn’t work with Cirrus. 

I also tidied up the project board, dividing up tasks and user stories for each sprint as well as adding the corresponding Scrum Master for each week. My other task about retrieving information from database to profile can’t be done because it needed work from others.

For next week, instead of waiting for preliminary tasks I should work on a new task that our team needs.

##Tibor:
This week, I finally merged the UserHelper class with full dependency injection and unit testing into main. I also began to improve the settings page, notably by adding the ability to change the user's email.
I think I worked around 8 hours this week, however merging the PR for UserHelper took me more time than initially thought, so I couldn't advance as much on the settings that what was planned.

For next week, I will take care to work sufficiently at the beginning of the week, so that I can close what is needed for the others earlier, and so that I don't get overwhelmed by the end of the week with too many tasks.

##Overall

This week we had a lot af work for the other courses and couldn't work as much as the previous weeks. This lack of time didn't stop us from advancing in our tasks that were better adapted to weakly sprints. We has our two meetings as the previous weeks. The merging timings were more expanded in the week and allowed us to work smoother.
