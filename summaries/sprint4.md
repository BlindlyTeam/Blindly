# Summary for Week 4

## Melissa
I added a way to navigate through the audio file with the seekbar. Dragging it pauses the audio and letting it go update the time of the audio file according to the position in the seekbar.

It didn’t take me too much time, just as much as I expected. The problem is I couldn’t merge with the main branch because Kilian is working on the same activity as me and it changed a lot from the activity I added my functionality to. Kilian will merge my implementation to its branch next sprint.

For the next sprint, I’ll take care of a more UI based task. I’ll add the possibility to change all preferences in the settings and I’ll give an update to the appearance of the overall settings.


## Capucine
I implemented the database to set the user’s information using Firebase firestore. And started on creating helper functions to retrieve these information from the database, they’re as for now untested. Unfortunately, some tests do not pass the build check on Cirrus, so I haven’t been able to merge these branches into the main yet.

So next week, I’ll continue working on these features and adding more tests to improve our test coverage. And later on link all the user data to the UI (display the correct name, email address location etc).


## Richard
This sprint, I began a new task: allowing the matches to be swiped. This task will probably take 2 weeks to finish. Most of this week, I read documentation on how to perform my task and tried to find some libraries to help me accomplish this. I began to write some code but it didn’t work well for the moment.

For next week I'll try to finish this task.


## Kilian (Scrum Master)
This sprint, I finished coding the UI for the recording activity. However, testing is not completely done yet and there are some bugs that must be resolved.

As stated before, this task is way longer than we expected. I think we generally thought that the UI was simpler to do.

For next week, I’ll finish polishing the recording activity and I’ll integrate what Melissa has done for the past 2 weeks in it (seekbar navigation and audio selection).


## Çağın
This week I worked on the refactoring, renamed class and function names to better explain use cases. Corrected some code styling issues and tried to minimize Cirrus warnings from all branches.

I couldn’t get to implement authentication with Facebook as my bachelor project took too much of my time this week.

Next week, I will try to better manage my time, complete the aforementioned task and also start to look for ways to implement chat features in our application.


## Overall Team
This week, we couldn’t work as much as we did in the beginning. Some of us had deadlines for their bachelor project and the sprint ended on Thursday instead of Friday.

The communication was good, even if we had only one stand-up meeting. I think we still need to improve working on more independent tasks and splitting them in an efficient manner.

It is hard for me to speak about estimations, since some of us didn’t have time to work this week. But I think we are better at estimating tasks if they are clearly targeted (it seems obvious, but it helps).

This next sprint, I think it is really important that we empty the sprint backlog and sprint tasks, because some things are there for more than 2 weeks already.
